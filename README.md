# Conformer-YOLO-HRNet: A Multimodal Framework for Dutar Performance Recognition

------

**Dutar**, as a traditional musical instrument, its learning method has historically relied mostly on oral transmission between masters and disciples. However, with the change of time, the teaching methods of Dutar have diversified, including traditional teacher-apprentice transmission, formal education in music schools, and the extensive use of online digital resources. Nonetheless, manual instruction is costly, and self-study lacks professional guidance. Despite the abundance of performance video resources on the Internet, the lack of complete tutorials or scores poses considerable difficulties for learners. In addition, most notation methods still rely on manual operation, which is not only time-consuming but also a waste of human resources. Therefore, this study proposes a **Conformer, HRNet, and YOLO-based Dutar performance recognition Multimodal model**, which aims to solve the above problems.

## The model is described and the code runs as follows:
